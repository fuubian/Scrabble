# Scrabble Implementation

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the Scrabble game, developed during the Spring/Summer 2021 semester at the University of Mannheim. The project was created by a team of five.

The repository is read-only and intended for viewing purposes. Classes authored by me are annotated with "frajwa" in the code.
